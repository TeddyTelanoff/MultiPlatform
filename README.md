==========

Summary of the Game
----------
A multiplayer shooter game that you can play with your friends! Host a game, and play, as long as you're on the same network! Choose from the three maps and game modes, and play with up to four player! Don't jump off the platforms, or you'll lose health. Don't get hit, or you'll lose health. Try to be the last one left, and show your family who's the best!

Play it Yourself
----------
Download the game, or run the code! Here on Github, you can clone this repository and open it in a Processing IDE to view, edit, and run the code! To download Processing, click here --> https://processing.org/download/!

To download the game, and play it, you can choose to download the client, the server, or both! The server is what allows you to run the game, and the clients are what let you play the game. ***IMPORTANT --> You need one server per group playing together. The client will not run on its own. The client will prompt you to input an ip, that will be shown on the server's window.***

Config
----------
In the data folders of both Client and Server projects, there is a file named 'config.json'. You can edit all the values inside the file, though we reccomend not to edit the 'comment'. Also, don't change the values on the left. For a more in-depth tutorial check out [JSON Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp)
